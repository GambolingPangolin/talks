# Bitcoin the project

## Repositories

- Many copies of code
- Issues and discussion of specifics on github
- Backups of everything exist and migration is possible

## Discussion

- Mailing lists (really nice to have a record)
- Social media
- Conferences

# Changing bitcoin

## Consensus vs. non-consensus changes

Consensus: 
- Which bitcoin transactions (and blocks) are valid
- Risk of "chain split" 

. . .

Non-consensus:
- Use green instead of blue for a UI element
- P2P message format

## Bitcoin defined by users

With whom do you want to use bitcoin?  You need to agree on a version.

## How to evaluate a proposal

::: incremental
- Is it useful?  Would you use it?
- Is there a prototype?
- Is there something similar on other blockchains?
- Does the change trip any &ldquo;must nots&rdquo;?

# Get involved

Best to go deep instead of broad.  Choose one project at a time.

## Beta testing

Install new software versions and use them.  Report bugs.

## Reading docs and suggesting improvements

Helps to have a github account

## Be active 

Contribute to public discussions.  We need people to try to make them good.

## Hire a developer

You can just pay a freelance dev to go help out on a project
